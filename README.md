# Wikipedia-Q-A-Project
Wikipedia question and answer program using python. Creates instance of a 'query' class when user enters question, which processes the raw question and provides a set of relevant articles.
The program then identifies the most relevant article and the three paragraphs most likely to contain the answer to the user query. A q-a pipeline is given these paragraphs as context
and then provides an answer. (Still being developed)
